# Real-Time Object Detection

This project implements real-time object detection using a pre-trained MobileNet SSD model. It captures video from your webcam and detects various objects in real-time.

- NumPy
- imutils

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realtime-object-detection.git
   cd realtime-object-detection
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:


pip install opencv-python numpy imutils
Download the pre-trained model:

You will need the MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt and MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel files. You can download them from the following links:
prototxt file
caffemodel file
Place these files in a model directory within your project folder.
Usage
Run the object detection script:


python cam_object_detection.py
Adjust the parameters if necessary:

You can specify the paths to the model files and the confidence threshold using command line arguments:

python cam_object_detection.py --prototxt path/to/MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt --model path/to/MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel --confidence 0.2
Stop the detection:

Press the 'x' key to exit the video stream and close the application.

### Notes
- Make sure to replace `https://github.com/yourusername/realtime-object-detection.git` with the actual URL of your repository.
- Ensure that the links to the model files are correct and accessible.
- Adjust any other sections according to your project structure or additional requirements.
